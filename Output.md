# Weekly Market Analysis: Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)

Hello dear user! Welcome to this week's WealthIQ analysis of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN). Let's dive into the latest developments and market performance of this tech giant.

## News and Overview

Amazon.com, Inc. engages in retail sales of consumer products, advertising, and subscription services through online and physical stores primarily in North America. On May 1, 2025, Amazon beat Wall Street's first-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, demonstrating its continued strength in the market. However, its guidance for operating income fell short of expectations, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud-services business, grew at a slower-than-expected pace for the third straight quarter.

CEO Andy Jassy addressed concerns about tariffs during the recent earnings call, stating: "Obviously, none of us knows exactly where tariffs will settle or when. We haven't seen any attenuation of demand yet." Jassy noted that Amazon has observed increased buying in certain categories, potentially indicating customers stocking up before potential tariff impacts.

Recent news also indicates that China may be evaluating the possibility of starting trade negotiations with the U.S., which could positively impact Amazon's operations given its dependence on Chinese-manufactured products.

## Recent Price Movements & Performance

As of May 5, 2025, Amazon's current stock price is $187.04 USD, showing a slight decrease of 0.12% in the past 24 hours. Despite this minor dip, AMZN stock has risen by 1.26% compared to the previous week and shows a 1.24% increase over the past month. Over the last year, Amazon has demonstrated a modest 0.12% increase.

Amazon reached its all-time high on February 4, 2025, with a price of $242.52 USD, which is approximately 30% higher than its current trading price. This indicates that the stock has experienced a significant correction over the past three months.

Investment firms have recently revised their price targets for Amazon. Wedbush maintains a positive outlook despite management's conservative guidance, noting that Amazon has beaten the high end of its operating-income guidance in each of the past nine quarters. Meanwhile, Oppenheimer has lowered its price target from $220 to $215 but still maintains an outperform rating.

## Key Takeaways / Investment Suggestion

**Buy (with caution):** Despite recent challenges, Amazon presents a compelling investment opportunity for several reasons:

1. **Consistent earnings outperformance:** Amazon has exceeded operating-income guidance for nine consecutive quarters, suggesting management tends to be conservative in their forecasts.

2. **Competitive advantage in uncertain times:** Amazon's core strategy of broad selection, competitive pricing, and fast delivery positions it well to navigate potential tariff headwinds.

3. **AWS capacity improvements:** While AWS growth has slowed, management indicates that capacity constraints are easing as the year progresses, which could lead to improved performance.

**Risk factors to consider:**
- Ongoing tariff uncertainties could impact product availability and pricing
- AWS growth deceleration is concerning as it's a high-margin business segment
- The stock is trading approximately 30% below its 2025 peak

Analysts have set price targets ranging from $195 to $290 USD, suggesting significant potential upside from current levels.

## Summary

Amazon continues to demonstrate strong fundamentals despite facing challenges from AWS growth deceleration and tariff uncertainties. The company's recent earnings beat, coupled with management's historically conservative guidance, suggests potential for outperformance in the coming quarters. While the stock has fallen significantly from its February 2025 peak, the current price point may represent an attractive entry opportunity for long-term investors, especially if U.S.-China trade tensions ease.
