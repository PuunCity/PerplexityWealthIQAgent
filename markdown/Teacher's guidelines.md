## Teacher's guidelines:

1. Use of the following Python concepts:
    
    - `if`-`else` statements
        
    - `for` and `while` loops
        
    - Reading from and writing to files (create/save/read)
        
    - `try`-`except` blocks for error handling
        
    - Lists and dictionaries
        
2. Your project must include **at least 4 AI agents** (these can be characters or components that make decisions, analyze data, interact with each other, etc.).
    

Your project will be reviewed, among other things already mentioned, with these criteria in mind, so be sure to integrate them meaningfully into your code.
