## What is the plan?
The plan is to create an AI agent (using Perplexity API) which will weekly send an email to it's users containing data of their asset of choice.

> [!important] Remember, don't depend on AI to "learn" or vibe code this project!

### Todo (things to learn):
- [x] How to integrate Perplexity's API
- [x] How to extract Mathplotlib code from Perplexity
- [x] Execute the graph code in a different environment
- [ ] Integrate the app as an email bot responding to email inputs
	- [ ] Receive emails
	- [ ] extract input
	- [ ] generate input
	- [ ] execute code as input
	- [x] output a .md file as the embedded email sent to the user
- [ ] Adjust the project to be respecting the teacher's guidelines
- [ ] Add more info ...
- [ ] Make the code more readable and apply logic for robust code
- [ ] Adjust the recommendations according to the budget of the user: (less than 1k... Over than 1k...)
- [ ] Adding a dictionary to handle previous prompts and keep a sort of history? 


> [!attention] handle multiple assets and generate all images!

## How can users access the service?
Ideally, a website where users can connect and set their input in without having to actually send an email would be ideal.

But that means a website with a landing page should be made.


## How can agents filter out flukes and non-valid content?
To do...


## So far:
The bot can send emails with .md files attached to it. It can't yet receive emails with input and it can't yet attach .png files it generated, still a challenge.
